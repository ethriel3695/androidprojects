     * The getWeatherForecastData method creates an HTTP Connection and
     * Input stream to get the results from the weather API
     * The HttpUrlConnection accepts the full API Url and opens the connection
     * The request method is set to GET and input and output is also set to true
     * A StringBuffer and BufferReader are used to to get the results of the Input Stream
     * A string variable accepts the results of each line of the BufferReader until the
     * BufferReader is null and then the while loop is exited
     * The InputStream is closed and the HTTP connection is disconnected and then the method
     * returns the string variable for data consumption
     * If an exception is thrown, the catch clause of the try-catch-finally will
     * display a message indicating the error and then the finally block closes all resources
     * and the method returns a null value rather than a data string
     * @param state is the value of the state based on the city choice from the dropdown Spinner
     *              The state variable will always be a two letter abbreviation of the state
     * @param city is the value of the city chosen from the dropdown and formatted in the
     *             following way "/cityName.json"
